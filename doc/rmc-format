== Retro music container (rmc) file format ==

Uses file extension ".rmc".

rmc file is defined by the the following Python
statement by using bencode serialization:

	bencode([MAGIC, meta, files])

where meta and files are dictionaries, and
MAGIC = 'rmc\x00\xfb\x13\xf6\x1f\xa2' (9 bytes).

The first 12 bytes of rmc file define a file magic (prefix):

    'l9:rmc\x00\xfb\x13\xf6\x1f\xa2'

Meta dictionary begins at offset 12 in RMC file.

Example in Python syntax:

>>> bencode(['rmc\x00\xfb\x13\xf6\x1f\xa2', {}, {}])
'l9:rmc\x00\xfb\x13\xf6\x1f\xa2dedee'

meta spec for 'amiga' files:

meta = {
    'platform': 'amiga',
    'subsongs': {INT_KEY: int},  # length in milliseconds

    OPTIONAL_KEY('authors'): [ONE_OR_MORE, str],
    OPTIONAL_KEY('format'): str,
    OPTIONAL_KEY('format_version'): str,
    OPTIONAL_KEY('notes'): str,
    OPTIONAL_KEY('song'): bytes,  # filename
    OPTIONAL_KEY('title'): str,
    OPTIONAL_KEY('year'): int,

    # Amiga specific fields
    OPTIONAL_KEY('player'): bytes,  # filename
    OPTIONAL_KEY('timer'): str,
    }

The meta spec for 'c64' files should contain STIL information.

'song' and 'player' filenames refer to a file located inside files
dictionary. 'song' is the name of the file to be played. If there is
only one file in the files dictionary, it is assumed to be the song
and this field is unnecessary.

'player' referes to the filename of the eagleplayer that should play the song.
If 'player' filename is not found from the files dictionary,
it can be heuristically looked up from uade's eagleplayer directory.

'subsongs' is a dictionary of subsongs starting from integer 0 and up.
meta['subsongs'][0] is the duration of subsong 0 in milliseconds,
meta['subsongs'][1] is the duration of subsong 1, etc.

Optional field 'format' refers to the name of the format.
The format field should be filled with the exact format if possible.
If it is filled, the player must obey it.
If it is not filled, the player may guess the format.

The format should be written as the original author of the format writes it.
A version number should be attached to the format name if correct replay of
the version number is necessary, e.g. 'ProTracker v2.3D'.

If the name of the format is not otherwise known from "good" sources,
it must be named. Please create a merge request for this file to add the
format name to the list of known format names below:

* 'AHX': Amiga AHX
* 'Custom': Amiga custom songs that do not represent any particular format.
  The playroutine is a part of the song file itself.
* 'Delta Music': Amiga Delta Music
  - meta['format_version'] can be one of ['1', '2']
* 'Future Composer: Amiga Future Composer
  - meta['format_version'] can be one of ['1.3', '1.4']
* 'NoiseTracker': Amiga NoiseTracker
  - meta['format_version'] can be one of ['1.0', '2.0', 'M&K.']
* 'ProTracker': Amiga ProTracker
  - meta['format_version'] can be one of ['1.0c', '1.1b', '2.1a', '2.3a',
    '3.0b']
* 'SoundTracker': Amiga NoiseTracker
  - meta['format_version'] can be one of ['2.0', '2.4']
* 'StarTrekker': Amiga StarTrekker

If meta['timer'] == 'vblank', the player should use a vertical blanking
interrupt for timing the playback (CIA timing should not be used).

File spec:

files = {bytes: bytes}

== Character encoding ==

Strings should be encoded with utf-8.
