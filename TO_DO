* Implement command line option to force a given eagleplayer. Preferably the
  same syntax as with uade123. E.g. Do the conversion with:

      rmc -P my-eagleplayer songname.

* Add -m option to force use of given meta string. This make it possibly to
  manually edit meta by first unpacking, then editing metastring file and then
  repacking the data.

* Encode relevant fields in RMC with utf-8
